# Python 104 DS Basics
 Notes && Mini-projects based on Sinan Ozdemir's book

I will work following the book's examples and exercises. 
Topics covered so far: 

- drop and create columns of a dataset with pandas 
- drop rows where there are NaN / NA values 
- clean the dataset based on criteria (e.g. LIKE op in SQL, WHERE op in SQL)
- standard deviation concept and calculation


## Looking forward to...

- drawing graphs 
- actually comparing data based on other columns of the dataset
